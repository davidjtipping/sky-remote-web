Web interface for sending remote control commands to a Sky TV box.

It is basic and *was* ugly, but functional.

#### Usage

Just start the script, and then open a browser at `http://localhost:29152`.

Ensure the text box at the top of the page contains the IP address of your Sky box.

Nothing more to it.
